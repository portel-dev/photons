## 🔧 Tools


### `main` ⚡

Open the Kanban board. Visual drag-and-drop board for managing tasks. Both humans and AI can interact with this board - humans through the UI, AI through MCP methods. ## AI Workflow (IMPORTANT). When working on tasks as an AI assistant: 1. **Check assigned tasks**: Use `mine` to find tasks assigned to you 2. **Work in "In Progress"**: Tasks you're actively working on should be here 3. **Move to "Review" when done**: Do NOT move directly to "Done"! - "Review" means: AI finished, waiting for human verification - Only humans should move tasks from "Review" to "Done" 4. **Add comments**: Document what you did for the reviewer. This keeps humans in the loop and ensures quality control.
