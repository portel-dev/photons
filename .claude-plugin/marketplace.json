Handle errors gracefully when MCPs are unavailable ## MCP Dependencies This photon can work with any MCPs configured in NCP: - `tavily` - Search API (Node.js MCP) - `browser` - Web automation (Node.js MCP) - `whatsapp` - Messaging (Python MCP via uv) - `sequential-thinking` - Reasoning (Node.js MCP) - Any other MCP configured in your NCP profile ## How it Works The `this.mcp('name')` method returns a proxy that: - Calls tools directly: `await this.mcp('tavily').search({ query: '...' })` - Lists tools: `await this.mcp('tavily').list()` - Finds tools: `await this.mcp('tavily').find('search')`",
